		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<div>See the base [page:Material] class for common parameters.</div>

		<h3>[property:Color color]</h3>
		<div>
		Diffuse color of the material. Default is white.<br />
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Color emissive]</h3>
		<div>
		Emissive (light) color of the material, essentially a solid color unaffected by other lighting. Default is black.<br />
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Color specular]</h3>
		<div>
		Specular color of the material, i.e., how shiny the material is and the color of its shine. Setting this the same color as the diffuse value (times some intensity) makes the material more metallic-looking; setting this to some gray makes the material look more plastic. Default is dark gray.<br />
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float shininess]</h3>
		<div>How shiny the specular highlight is; a higher value gives a sharper highlight. Default is *30*. It should not be set to 0.</div>

		<h3>[property:boolean metal]</h3>
		<div>
			If set to true the shader multiplies the specular highlight by the underlying color of the object, making
			it appear to be more metal-like and darker. If set to false the specular highlight is added ontop of the
			underlying colors.
		</div> 

		<h3>[property:boolean wrapAround]</h3>
		<div>
			Define whether the diffuse lighting wraps around the model or not. This option adds a little more (tintable) light
			onto the side of the object in relation to a light.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Vector3 wrapRGB]</h3>
		<div>
			Decide how much of the wrap around values get used if the wrapAround option is set. The x, y, z values correspond
			to the r, g, b values respectively. The typical range is of each is from 0 to 1. For example setting all of the
			vector values to 0.5 will add a moderate amount of light to the side of the model. Changing *b* to 1 will
			tint the light on the side to be more blue. Defaults to (1,1,1).
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Texture map]</h3>
		<div>Set color texture map. Default is null.</div>

		<h3>[property:Texture lightMap]</h3>
		<div>Set light map. Default is null.</div>

		<h3>[property:Texture bumpMap]</h3>
		<div>
			The texture to create a bump map. The black and white values map to the perceived depth in relation to the lights.
			Bump doesn't actually affect the geometry of the object, only the lighting. If a normal map is defined this will
			be ignored.
		</div>
		
		<h3>[property:Float bumpScale]</h3>
		<div>
			How much the bump map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1. Default is 1.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Texture normalMap]</h3>
		<div>
			The texture to create a normal map. The RGB values affect the surface normal for each pixel fragment and change
			the way the color is lit. Normal maps do not change the actual shape of the surface, only the lighting.
		</div>
		
		<h3>[property:Vector2 normalScale]</h3>
		<div>
			How much the normal map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1. Default is (1,1).
		</div> 

		<h3>[property:Texture specularMap]</h3>
		<div>The specular map value affects both how much the specular surface highlight contributes and how much of the environment map affects the surface. Default is null.</div>

		<h3>[property:Texture alphaMap]</h3>
		<div>The alpha map is a grayscale texture that controls the opacity across the surface (black: fully transparent; white: fully opaque). Default is null.</div>
		<div>Only the color of the texture is used, ignoring the alpha channel if one exists. For RGB and RGBA textures, the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer will use the green channel when sampling this texture due to the extra bit of precision provided for green in DXT-compressed and uncompressed RGB 565 formats. Luminance-only and luminance/alpha textures will also still work as expected.</div>

		<h3>[property:TextureCube envMap]</h3>
		<div>Set env map. Default is null.</div>
		
		<h3>[property:Integer combine]</h3>
		<div>How to combine the result of the surface's color with the environment map, if any.</div> 
		 
		<div>Options are [page:Textures THREE.MultiplyOperation] (default), [page:Textures THREE.MixOperation], [page:Textures THREE.AddOperation]. If mix is chosen, the reflectivity is used to blend between the two colors.</div>
		 
		<h3>[property:Float reflectivity]</h3>
		<div>How much the environment map affects the surface; also see "combine".</div> 

		<h3>[property:Float refractionRatio]</h3>
		<div>The index of refraction for an environment map using [page:Textures THREE.CubeRefractionMapping]. Default is *0.98*.</div>

		<h3>[property:Boolean fog]</h3>
		<div>Define whether the material color is affected by global fog settings. Default is *true*.</div>
		<div>This setting might not have any effect when used with certain renderers. For example, it is ignored with the [page:CanvasRenderer Canvas] renderer, but does work with the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer.</div>

		<h3>[property:Integer shading]</h3>
		<div>How the triangles of a curved surface are rendered: as a smooth surface, as flat separate facets, or no shading at all.</div>

		<div>Options are [page:Materials THREE.SmoothShading] (default), [page:Materials THREE.FlatShading], [page:Materials THREE.NoShading].</div>
		
		<h3>[property:Boolean wireframe]</h3>
		<div>Whether the triangles' edges are displayed instead of surfaces. Default is *false*.</div>
		
		<h3>[property:Float wireframeLinewidth]</h3>
		<div>Line thickness for wireframe mode. Default is *1.0*.</div>
		<div>Due to limitations in the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/angleproject/" target="_blank">ANGLE layer</a>, on Windows platforms linewidth will always be 1 regardless of the set value.</div>

		<h3>[property:String wireframeLinecap]</h3>
		<div>Define appearance of line ends. Possible values are "butt", "round" and "square". Default is 'round'.</div>
		<div>This setting might not have any effect when used with certain renderers. For example, it is ignored with the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer, but does work with the [page:CanvasRenderer Canvas] renderer.</div>

		<h3>[property:String wireframeLinejoin]</h3>
		<div>Define appearance of line joints. Possible values are "round", "bevel" and "miter". Default is 'round'.</div>
		<div>This setting might not have any effect when used with certain renderers. For example, it is ignored with the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer, but does work with the [page:CanvasRenderer Canvas] renderer.</div>

		<h3>[property:Integer vertexColors]</h3>
		<div>Define how the vertices gets colored. Possible values are THREE.NoColors, THREE.FaceColors and THREE.VertexColors. Default is THREE.NoColors.</div>
		<div>This setting might not have any effect when used with certain renderers. For example, it is ignored with the [page:CanvasRenderer Canvas] renderer, but does work with the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer.</div>

		<h3>[property:Boolean skinning]</h3>
		<div>Define whether the material uses skinning. Default is *false*.</div>
	
		<h3>[property:Boolean morphTargets]</h3>
		<div>Define whether the material uses morphTargets. Default is *false*.</div>	

		<h3>[property:boolean morphNormals]</h3>
		<div>
			Defines whether the material uses morphNormals. Set as true to pass morphNormal attributes from the [page:Geometry]
			to the shader. Default is *false*.
		</div>
