		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">A line or a series of lines.</div>


		<h2>Example</h2>


		<code>var material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
			color: 0x0000ff
		});

		var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
		geometry.vertices.push(
			new THREE.Vector3( -10, 0, 0 ),
			new THREE.Vector3( 0, 10, 0 ),
			new THREE.Vector3( 10, 0, 0 )
		);

		var line = new THREE.Line( geometry, material );
		scene.add( line );
		</code>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]( [page:Geometry geometry], [page:Material material], [page:Integer type] )</h3>

		<div>
		geometry — Vertices representing the line segment(s).<br />
		material — Material for the line. Default is [page:LineBasicMaterial LineBasicMaterial].<br />
		type — Connection type between vertices. Default is THREE.LineStrip.
		</div>

		<div>If no material is supplied, a randomized line material will be created and assigned to the object.</div>

		<div>Also, if no type is supplied, the default (THREE.LineStrip) will be used).</div>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Geometry geometry]</h3>
		<div>
		Vertices representing the line segment(s).
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Material material]</h3>
		<div>
		Material for the line.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Integer type]</h3>
		<div>
		Possible values: THREE.LineStrip or THREE.LinePieces. THREE.LineStrip will draw a series of segments connecting each point (first connected to the second, the second connected to the third, and so on and so forth); and THREE.LinePieces will draw a series of pairs of segments (first connected to the second, the third connected to the fourth, and so on and so forth).</div>

		<div>
		In OpenGL terms, LineStrip is the classic GL_LINE_STRIP and LinePieces is the equivalent to GL_LINES.
		</div>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:Array raycast]([page:Raycaster raycaster], [page:Array intersects])</h3>
		<div>
		Get intersections between a casted ray and this Line. [page:Raycaster.intersectObject] will call this method.
		</div>
